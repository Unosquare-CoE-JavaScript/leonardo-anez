# Chapter 4: The Bigger Picture

This chapter emphasizes the pillars of JS:
1. **Scope and Closure**: Scopes are like buckets, and variables are like marbles you put into those buckets. Across all ofprogramming, but especially in JS, closure drives many ofthe most important programming patterns, including modules.

2. **Prototypes**: JS is one of very few languages where you have the option to create objects directly and explicitly, without first defining their structure in a class.

3. **Types and Coercion**: Arguably, this pillar is more important than the other two, in the sense that no JS program will do anything useful if it doesn’t properly leverage JS’s value types, as well as the conversion (coercion) of values between types.
